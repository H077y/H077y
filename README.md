# Projects
> I run Dr√°kon Productions and we have plenty of projects under our belt! Check them out:
## Pride Flag Emojis
Pride flag emojis is a project to allow anyone to access their pride flags in Twemoji format. It's primarily for use as Discord emojis, but they can be used for anything. All emojis are publicly available for download and can be used whenever. If you want to a flag added, or want to make one yourself, check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/H077y/pride-flag-emojis) for instructions!\
Alternatively, you can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8w6uVTEnJJ) were we host almost all of the emojis we're requested, and where we receieve most of our flag requests.
## The Furtress
The Furtress is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8nrC3vDa7g) made for furries. It's themed on a medieval castle, fit for a community. As of writing this (14/10/23), it's brand new!\
We plan on creating species and running events for all to enjoy. We have a verification system to keep malicious users out, and we have a strong automod to detect anyone that slips through.\
Come join us!
